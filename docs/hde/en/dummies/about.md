<br/>Sometimes your web application has so many exceptions with different origins and handling strategies. And you want
to find a better way to handle and manage them.

So did we. We had dozens exception classes and hundreds of exceptions. And one day we were fed up; all our problems
and inconveniences concerning exceptions were documented and discussed. Some bright ideas appeared that day...

The library offers you these classes:
- [GlobalException](global-exception.md)
- [CustomizableException](customizable-exception.md)
- [Parser](parser.md)
